/*
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable
and predictable manner. It use the try/catch statement to catch exceptions
that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with
the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic
failure or nasty bug.
