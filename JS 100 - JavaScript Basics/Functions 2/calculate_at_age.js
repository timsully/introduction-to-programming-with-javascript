Implement a function catAge that takes a number of human years as input
and converts them into cat years. Cat years are calculated as follows:

- The first human year corresponds to 15 cat years.
- The second human year corresponds to 9 cat years.
- Every subsequent human year corresponds to 4 cat years.
