/*
Change the function greet from the previous exercise, so that it takes
two arguments: a greeting with 'Hello' as default value, and a recipient
with 'world' as default value. The behavior should then be as follows:
*/
function greet(greeting = "Hello", recipient = "world") {
  console.log(greeting + ", " + recipient + "!");
}

greet();                                // logs: Hello, world!
greet('Salutations');                   // logs: Salutations, world!
greet('Good morning', 'Launch School'); // logs: Good morning, Launch School!
