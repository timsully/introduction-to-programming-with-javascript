/*
Write a function clone that takes an object as argument and returns
a shallow copy of that argument. Shallow copy means that it returns
a new object that has the same key/value pairs, but that you don't
need to worry about cloning the values as well. The code below
demonstrates the expected behaviour.

  return Object.assign({}, obj);

  title: 'Duke',

let clonedPerson = clone(person);
person.age = 34;

console.log(person.age);       // 34
console.log(clonedPerson.age); // 33
