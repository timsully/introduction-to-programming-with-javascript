/*
What is the difference between the following two code snippets?
Check the MDN documentation on while and do...while.

A while loop evaluates the condition before executing the statement
and a do...while loop evaluates the condition after executing the statement.
Both statements execute the given block as long as the condition evaluates to
true.
